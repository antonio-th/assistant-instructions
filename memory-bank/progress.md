# Progress

## What Works
- MCP server starts and runs
- get-instructions-file tool returns expected path
- Standard MCP protocol compliance

## What's Left to Build
- Test coverage analysis (test.js examination)
- Enhanced instruction file discovery
- Additional tool possibilities

## Current Status
- ✅ Basic MCP server functional
- ✅ Memory bank established
- ⏳ Testing approach unknown
- ⏳ Enhancement opportunities identified

## Known Issues
- Hardcoded file path limits flexibility
- Single tool may be too narrow

## Evolution
Started as minimal MCP implementation, ready for expansion based on actual use cases.
